        <h1>Computer Science</h1>
        <p>Computer Science discipline was introduced back around 1940s as several key technological
          advances were achieved during its time. It primarily focuses on computing theory, algorithms, and programming.
          Alan Mathison Turing was considered as the father of computer science with his invention of the first modern
          computer known as the Turing Machine back in 1936.
          <br><br>
          Computer Science utilizes algorithms to store, manipulate, and communicate digital information. This field
          also involves in building and implementing computing systems, both in terms of software development and
          hardware design.
          <br><br>
          It does not only include programming, but also designing hardware and operating system layers,
          developing system architectures, and structuring databases.

        <h1>Computer Engineering</h1>
        <p>
          In 1939, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford Berry started Computer Engineering with the help of electrical
          engineering, physics and mathematics to create the first electronic digital computer.
          <br><br>
          The field of Computer Engineering combines both electronic engineering and computer science disciplines to
          create computer hardware and software.
          <br><br>
          Computer engineers involves in writing software and firmware for embedded microcontrollers, designing VLSI
          chips, analog sensors, mixed-signal circuit boards, and operating systems.

        <h1>Information Systems</h1>
        <p>
          Information system helps collect, process, store, evaluate and distribute information for a specific purpose.
          Businesses and organizations utilizes information system to ensure efficiency of their business operations.
          <br><br>
          It consists of five major components, namely hardware components and software components, data, procedures and
          system users, that work together to create information out of raw data.
          <br><br>
          The 5 types of Information Systems include Transaction Processing Systems, Management Information Systems,
          Decision Support Systems, Enterprise Resource Planning Systems, and Customer Relationship Management Systems.

        <h1>Information Technology</h1>
        <p>
          Information Technology primarily focuses on the technology such as hardware, software, networks, and databases
          that is used for information management and storage.
          <br><br>
          Information Technology is all about using computer systems to obtain and manage information. Moreover, IT
          specialists are responsible for selecting, integrating, installing, customizing, and maintaining hardware and
          software suited for the business’ needs.

        <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
        <p>
          Software Engineering is about developing cost-effective and high-quality software systems that meets user
          needs. It is responsible with the design, development, testing, and management of software systems.
          <br><br>
          This field is applied in developing large-scale software projects involving software systems rather
          than single programs or applications.
          <br><br>
          It then follows every stage of software production, from system specification to maintaining the system.
